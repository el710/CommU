## Prolog
The need to make large communities passed test of time with unsatisfaction results:

- Common menegment model also has group size limit. Large group can't be managed commonly
Main problem: 'information exchange' is limited in volume and spreading
Now the Time for information technologies!!!

Main task: Make tools to help to manage men own daily tasks and resourses, help to unite and cooperate with each other to solve the problems: in own life, in family, at home and at work.
To give understanding, that only human itself can solve his problems right ways, by hisself or with help of communities, and none *"General"* will take really care about him.
