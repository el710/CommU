# Project "CommU"
*Human!
       Protect the Flame of Prometheus from the darkness of ignorance.*

## Prolog
The needs to unite humans in one community passed test of time with unsatisfaction results:

- Centralized management model can be effective only for the small groups, where all the processes are obvious for everyone.
- Common managment model also has group size limit. 
```
Large group can't be managed effectively
```
**Main problem:
The composition of Homo representatives will never change. This is the basis of nature's genetics.
Mankind will always represent a mixture of individuals of different levels of consciousness from Buddha to Hitler.
And only proportion will play a role.
None level of civilization will change this!**

Here is the solve:
An effective unification model is the coexistence of multiple business groups of people.
And it is much better if the groups are smaller and the number of groups is larger.
In a smaller group, people are more free
