# Project "CommU"
Human!
       Protect the Flame of Prometheus from the darkness of ignorance.

## Prolog
The need to make large communities passed test of time with unsatisfaction results:

- Centralized management model can be effective only for the small groups, where all the processes are obvious for everyone.
- Common managment model also has group size limit. Large group can't be managed commonly
  
Main problem: 'information exchange' is limited in volume and spreading

Now the Time for information technologies!!!

Main task: Make tools to help to manage men own daily tasks and resourses, help to unite and cooperate with each other to solve the problems: in own life, in family, at home and at work.
To give understanding, that only human itself can solve his problems right ways, by itself or with help of communities, and none *"General"* will take really care about him.
