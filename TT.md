# Prolog

The needs to unite humans in one community passed test of time with such results:

- Humans never change;
- Large group leaders become unmanageable;
- Any life management model can be effective only for the small groups, where all the processes are obvious for everyone.

**Circumstances:
The composition of Homo representatives will never change. This is the basis of nature's genetics.
Mankind will always represent a mixture of individuals of different levels of consciousness from Buddha to Hitler.
None level of civilization will change this!**

Here is the one vision:
An effective unification model is the coexistence of multiple business groups of people.
And it is much better if the groups are smaller and the number of groups is larger.
In a smaller group, people are more free
